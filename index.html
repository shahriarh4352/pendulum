            <h1>Background Information</h1>
            <h3>I selected pendulums because they have always fascinated me. Pendulums are a very common thing that can be found in many forms, from theme park attractions like the one in the background, Crazanity, which is in Six Flags, to simple pendulums that you can buy and place on your desk. I once knew someone who had one of them, and I found it very interesting how it could keep swinging for so long.</h3>

                <div class="text-column">
                    <h3>In this experiment I plan on testing the effects of various factors on the period of the pendulum. <br></br>
                        These factors include: <u>angle of displacement, length of string, and mass of bob</u>. <br></br>
                        I predict that increasing length and angle of displacement will cause the period to increase, while increasing the mass of the bob will lower the period.</h3>

                        1) Measure weights of washers and length of string, before securing the pivot point by hanging it between two distant surfaces. <br></br>
                        2) During first experiment, test how long it takes for 1 washer to swing at acute and obtuse angles of displacement, and repeat the same for 3 washers at once, while recording the same steps. <br></br>
                        3) Use a shorter string and record the periods of 1 washer and 3 washers.</h3>

            <p>One trend that we can see is that the shorter the length, the shorter the period. This aligns with my hypothesis. However, my other two hypotheses are wrong, as we can see that changing the mass of the bob and altering the angle of displacement have no effect on the period.</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>Testing the effects of various factors on the period of a pendulum can offer many real-world applications. Many things in our everyday lives are pendulums, such as swings, amusement park rides, and analog clocks. The results of our testing can offer new insights transferable to the real world.</p>
            <br>
            <p>When deriving the period of a pendulum using the simple pendulum formula, I found that I had an average percent error of 23.52%. In any future experiments, the following adjustments should be made:</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>Make sure the project is done in a room without wind coming in from outside.</li>
                <li>Use a more rigid point of support between the two surfaces.</li>
            </ul>
